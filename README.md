Welcome! 

Here are my solutions of the Harvard's CS50 course's problems (./Solutions). Some portion of solutions (first weeks) were wtitten in java because I did not consider C as a language I need to learn, but when there lectures on memory started I had to realize its importance. 

Descriptions of the problems are stored in the JupyterNB file (./HarvardCS50_problems.ipynb). ./data directory contains supplementary files for problems description (like images, gifs, etc.).
