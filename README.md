Welcome! 

Here are my solutions of the Harvard's CS50 course's problems (./Solutions). Solutions are written primarily in java language, but some are in Python and C. 

Descriptions of the problems are stored in the JupyterNB file (./HarvardCS50_problems.ipynb). ./data directory contains supplementary files for problems description (like images, gifs, etc.).
