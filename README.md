Welcome! 

Here are my solutions of the Harvard's CS50 course problems (./Solutions). Solutions are written primarily in java language, but some are in python. 

Descriptions of the problems are stored in the JupyterNB file (./HarvardCS50_problems.ipynb). ./data directory contains supplementary files for problems descrition (like images, gifs, etc.).
