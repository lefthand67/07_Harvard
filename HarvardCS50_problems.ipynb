    "\n",
    "A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a number that’s also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers. And those are decimal numbers (0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 unique cards! (That’s, um, a quadrillion.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, because credit card numbers actually have some structure to them. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won’t concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4. But credit card numbers also have a “checksum” built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and others. That checksum enables computers (or humans who like math) to detect typos (e.g., transpositions), if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database, which can be slow. Of course, a dishonest mathematician could certainly craft a fake number that nonetheless respects the mathematical constraint, so a database lookup is still necessary for more rigorous checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what’s the secret formula? Well, most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM. According to Luhn’s algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.\n",
    "2. Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.\n",
    "3. If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s kind of confusing, so let’s try an example with David’s Visa: 4003600000000014.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the sake of discussion, let’s first underline every other digit, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p><u>4</u>0<u>0</u>3<u>6</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>1</u>4</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Okay, let’s multiply each of the underlined digits by 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 6•2 + 0•2 + 4•2\n",
    "\n",
    "    That gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 8\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now let’s add those products’ digits (i.e., not the products themselves) together:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now let’s add that sum (13) to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2 (starting from the end):\n",
    "\n",
    "    13 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Yup, the last digit in that sum (20) is a 0, so David’s card is legit!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, validating credit card numbers isn’t hard, but it does get a bit tedious by hand. Let’s write a program."

    "In a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every letter with another letter. To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it. To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text (generally called **ciphertext**) back into the original message (generally called **plaintext**).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key, for example, might be the string `NQXPOMAFTRHLZGECYJIUWSKDVB`. This 26-character key means that `A` (the first letter of the alphabet) should be converted into `N` (the first character of the key), `B` (the second letter of the alphabet) should be converted into `Q` (the second character of the key), and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A message like `HELLO`, then, would be encrypted as `FOLLE`, replacing each of the letters according to the mapping determined by the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s write a program called `substitution` that enables you to encrypt messages using a substitution cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, on what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of how the program might work. For example, if the user inputs a key of `YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO` and a plaintext of `HELLO`:\n",

    "Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at `plurality.c` and read through the distribution code that’s been provided to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line `#define MAX 9` is some syntax used here to mean that `MAX` is a constant (equal to `9`) that can be used throughout the program. Here, it represents the maximum number of candidates an election can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file then defines a `struct` called a `candidate`. Each candidate has two fields: a `string` called `name` representing the candidate’s name, and an `int` called `votes` representing the number of votes the candidate has. Next, the file defines a `global array` of candidates, where each element is itself a candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, take a look at the `main` function itself. See if you can find where the program sets a global variable `candidate_count` representing the number of candidates in the election, copies command-line arguments into the array candidates, and asks the user to type in the number of voters. Then, the program lets every voter type in a vote (see how?), calling the vote function on each candidate voted for. Finally, main makes a call to the print_winner function to print out the winner (or winners) of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look further down in the file, though, you’ll notice that the `vote` and `print_winner` functions have been left blank. This part is up to you to complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of `plurality.c` in such a way that the program simulates a plurality vote election.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the `vote` function. `vote` takes a single argument, a string called name, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for.\n",
    "    - If name matches one of the names of the candidates in the election, then update that candidate’s vote total to account for the new vote. The vote function in this case should return `true` to indicate a successful ballot.\n",
    "    - If name does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change, and the `vote` function should return `false` to indicate an invalid ballot.\n",
    "    - You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the `print_winner` function.\n",
    "    - The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes in the election, and then print a newline.\n",
    "    - It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have the maximum number of votes. In that case, you should output the names of each of the winning candidates, each on a separate line.\n",

    "Imagine that you travel back in time to the 1970’s, when the C programming language was first created. You are hired as a programmer to come up with a way to convert strings to ints. (You may have used a function just like this in Week 2, called [atoi](https://manual.cs50.io/3/atoi)). You want to be thorough in your development process and plan to try several approaches before deciding on the most efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will start with a simple implementation of `atoi` that handles positive ints using loops. You want to rework this into an implementation that uses recursion. Recusive functions can be memory intensive and are not always the best solution, but there are some problems in which using recursion can provide a simpler and more elegant solution.\n",

    "In the recursive version of convert, start with the last `char` and `convert` it into an integer value. Then shorten the string, removing the last `char`, and then recursively call `convert` using the shortened string as input, where the next `char` will be processed.\n",
