    "\n",
    "A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a number that’s also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers. And those are decimal numbers (0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 unique cards! (That’s, um, a quadrillion.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, that’s a bit of an exaggeration, because credit card numbers actually have some structure to them. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won’t concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4. But credit card numbers also have a “checksum” built into them, a mathematical relationship between at least one number and others. That checksum enables computers (or humans who like math) to detect typos (e.g., transpositions), if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database, which can be slow. Of course, a dishonest mathematician could certainly craft a fake number that nonetheless respects the mathematical constraint, so a database lookup is still necessary for more rigorous checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what’s the secret formula? Well, most cards use an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM. According to Luhn’s algorithm, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.\n",
    "2. Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.\n",
    "3. If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s kind of confusing, so let’s try an example with David’s Visa: 4003600000000014.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For the sake of discussion, let’s first underline every other digit, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <p><u>4</u>0<u>0</u>3<u>6</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>0</u>0<u>1</u>4</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Okay, let’s multiply each of the underlined digits by 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 6•2 + 0•2 + 4•2\n",
    "\n",
    "    That gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 8\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now let’s add those products’ digits (i.e., not the products themselves) together:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now let’s add that sum (13) to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2 (starting from the end):\n",
    "\n",
    "    13 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Yup, the last digit in that sum (20) is a 0, so David’s card is legit!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, validating credit card numbers isn’t hard, but it does get a bit tedious by hand. Let’s write a program."

    "For this problem, you’ll write a program that implements a substitution cipher, per the below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "plaintext:  HELLO\n",
    "ciphertext: VKXXN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every letter with another letter. To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it. To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text (generally called **ciphertext**) back into the original message (generally called **plaintext**).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key, for example, might be the string `NQXPOMAFTRHLZGECYJIUWSKDVB`. This 26-character key means that `A` (the first letter of the alphabet) should be converted into `N` (the first character of the key), `B` (the second letter of the alphabet) should be converted into `Q` (the second character of the key), and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A message like `HELLO`, then, would be encrypted as `FOLLE`, replacing each of the letters according to the mapping determined by the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s write a program called `substitution` that enables you to encrypt messages using a substitution cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, on what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of how the program might work. For example, if the user inputs a key of `YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO` and a plaintext of `HELLO`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "plaintext:  HELLO\n",
    "ciphertext: EHBBQ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the program might work if the user provides a key of `VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOI` and a plaintext of `hello, world`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "plaintext:  hello, world\n",
    "ciphertext: jrssb, ybwsp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that neither the comma nor the space were substituted by the cipher. Only substitute alphabetical characters! Notice, too, that the case of the original message has been preserved. Lowercase letters remain lowercase, and uppercase letters remain uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the characters in the key itself are uppercase or lowercase doesn’t matter. A key of `VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOI` is functionally identical to a key of `vchprzgjntlskfbdqwaxeuymoi` (as is, for that matter, `VcHpRzGjNtLsKfBdQwAxEuYmOi`).\n",
    "\n",
    "And what if a user doesn’t provide a valid key? The program should explain with an error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Key must contain 26 characters.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or really doesn’t cooperate, providing no command-line argument at all? The program should remind the user how to use the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "Usage: ./substitution key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or really, really doesn’t cooperate, providing too many command-line arguments? The program should also remind the user how to use the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 2 3\n",
    "Usage: ./substitution key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a program, substitution, that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement your program in a file called substitution.c in a directory called substitution.\n",
    "- Your program must accept a single command-line argument, the `key` to use for the substitution. The `key` itself should be case-insensitive, so whether any character in the `key` is uppercase or lowercase should not affect the behavior of your program.\n",
    "- If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error message of your choice (with `printf`) and return from main a value of `1` (which tends to signify an error) immediately.\n",
    "- If the `key` is invalid (as by not containing 26 characters, containing any character that is not an alphabetic character, or not containing each letter exactly once), your program should print an error message of your choice (with `printf`) and return from `main` a value of `1` immediately.\n",
    "- Your program must output `plaintext`: (without a newline) and then prompt the user for a string of `plaintext` (using `get_string`).\n",
    "- Your program must output `ciphertext`: (without a newline) followed by the plaintext’s corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext substituted for the corresponding character in the ciphertext; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.\n",
    "- Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters must remain lowercase letters.\n",
    "- After outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline. Your program should then exit by returning `0` from main."

    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Elections come in all shapes and sizes. In the UK, the Prime Minister is officially appointed by the monarch, who generally chooses the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons. The United States uses a multi-step Electoral College process where citizens vote on how each state should allocate Electors who then elect the President.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at `plurality.c` and read through the distribution code that’s been provided to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line `#define MAX 9` is some syntax used here to mean that `MAX` is a constant (equal to `9`) that can be used throughout the program. Here, it represents the maximum number of candidates an election can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file then defines a `struct` called a `candidate`. Each candidate has two fields: a `string` called `name` representing the candidate’s name, and an `int` called `votes` representing the number of votes the candidate has. Next, the file defines a `global array` of candidates, where each element is itself a candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, take a look at the `main` function itself. See if you can find where the program sets a global variable `candidate_count` representing the number of candidates in the election, copies command-line arguments into the array candidates, and asks the user to type in the number of voters. Then, the program lets every voter type in a vote (see how?), calling the vote function on each candidate voted for. Finally, main makes a call to the print_winner function to print out the winner (or winners) of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look further down in the file, though, you’ll notice that the `vote` and `print_winner` functions have been left blank. This part is up to you to complete!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of `plurality.c` in such a way that the program simulates a plurality vote election.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the `vote` function. `vote` takes a single argument, a string called name, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for.\n",
    "    - If name matches one of the names of the candidates in the election, then update that candidate’s vote total to account for the new vote. The vote function in this case should return `true` to indicate a successful ballot.\n",
    "    - If name does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change, and the `vote` function should return `false` to indicate an invalid ballot.\n",
    "    - You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the `print_winner` function.\n",
    "    - The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes in the election, and then print a newline.\n",
    "    - It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have the maximum number of votes. In that case, you should output the names of each of the winning candidates, each on a separate line.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You should not modify anything else in `plurality.c` other than the implementations of the `vote` and `print_winner` functions (and the inclusion of additional header files, if you’d like).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**\n",

    "Based on the resulting graph, Charlie is the source (there’s no arrow pointing towards Charlie), so Charlie is declared the winner of this election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put more formally, the Tideman voting method consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tally: Once all of the voters have indicated all of their preferences, determine, for each pair of candidates, who the preferred candidate is and by what margin they are preferred.\n",
    "- Sort: Sort the pairs of candidates in decreasing order of strength of victory, where strength of victory is defined to be the number of voters who prefer the preferred candidate.\n",
    "- Lock: Starting with the strongest pair, go through the pairs of candidates in order and “lock in” each pair to the candidate graph, so long as locking in that pair does not create a cycle in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the graph is complete, the source of the graph (the one with no edges pointing towards it) is the winner!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at `tideman.c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, notice the two-dimensional array preferences. The integer `preferences[i][j]` will represent the number of voters who prefer candidate `i` over candidate `j`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file also defines another two-dimensional array, called `locked`, which will represent the candidate graph. `locked` is a `boolean` array, so `locked[i][j]` being `true` represents the existence of an edge pointing from candidate `i` to candidate `j`; `false` means there is no edge. (If curious, this representation of a graph is known as an “[adjacency matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is a `struct` called `pair`, used to represent a pair of candidates: each pair includes the `winner`’s candidate index and the `loser`’s candidate index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The candidates themselves are stored in the array `candidates`, which is an array of strings representing the names of each of the candidates. There’s also an array of `pairs`, which will represent all of the pairs of candidates (for which one is preferred over the other) in the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program also has two global variables: `pair_count` and `candidate_count`, representing the number of pairs and number of candidates in the arrays pairs and candidates, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now onto `main`. Notice that after determining the number of candidates, the program loops through the `locked` graph and initially sets all of the values to `false`, which means our initial graph will have no edges in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the program loops over all of the voters and collects their preferences in an array called `ranks` (via a call to `vote`), where `ranks[i]` is the index of the candidate who is the `i`th preference for the voter. These ranks are passed into the `record_preference` function, whose job is to take those ranks and update the global `preferences` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of the votes are in, the pairs of candidates are added to the `pairs` array via a call to `add_pairs`, sorted via a call to `sort_pairs`, and locked into the graph via a call to `lock_pairs`. Finally, `print_winner` is called to print out the name of the election’s winner!\n",
    "\n",
    "Further down in the file, you’ll see that the functions vote, record_preference, add_pairs,sort_pairs, lock_pairs, and print_winner are left blank. That’s up to you!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of `tideman.c` in such a way that it simulates a Tideman election.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the `vote` function.\n",
    "    - The function takes arguments `rank`, `name`, and `ranks`. \n",
    "    - If name is a match for the name of a valid candidate, then you should update the `ranks` array to indicate that the voter has the candidate as their rank preference (where `0` is the first preference, `1` is the second preference, etc.). Recall that `ranks[i]` here represents the user’s `i`th preference.\n",
    "    - The function should return `true` if the rank was successfully recorded, and `false` otherwise (if, for instance, `name` is not the name of one of the candidates).\n",
    "    - You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.\n",
    "- Complete the `record_preferences` function.\n",
    "    - The function is called once for each voter, and takes as argument the `ranks` array (recall that `ranks[i]` is the voter’s `i`th preference, where `ranks[0]` is the first preference). \n",
    "    - The function should update the global `preferences` array to add the current voter’s preferences. Recall that `preferences[i][j]` should represent the number of voters who prefer candidate `i` over candidate `j`.\n",
    "    - You may assume that every voter will rank each of the candidates.\n",
    "- Complete the `add_pairs` function.\n",
    "    - The function should add all pairs of candidates where one candidate is preferred to the `pairs` array. A pair of candidates who are tied (one is not preferred over the other) should not be added to the array. \n",
    "    - The function should update the global variable `pair_count` to be the number of pairs of candidates. (The pairs should thus all be stored between `pairs[0]` and `pairs[pair_count - 1]`, inclusive).\n",
    "- Complete the `sort_pairs` function.\n",
    "    - The function should sort the `pairs` array in decreasing order of strength of victory, where strength of victory is defined to be the number of voters who prefer the preferred candidate. \n",
    "    - If multiple pairs have the same strength of victory, you may assume that the order does not matter.\n",
    "- Complete the `lock_pairs` function.\n",
    "    - The function should create the `locked` graph, adding all edges in decreasing order of victory strength so long as the edge would not create a cycle.\n",
    "- Complete the `print_winner` function.\n",
    "    - The function should print out the name of the candidate who is the source of the graph. You may assume there will not be more than one source.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You should not modify anything else in `tideman.c` other than the implementations of the `vote`, `record_preferences`, `add_pairs`, `sort_pairs`, `lock_pairs`, and `print_winner` functions (and the inclusion of additional header files, if you’d like). You are permitted to add additional functions to `tideman.c`, so long as you do not change the declarations of any of the existing functions."

(You may have used a function just like this in Week 2, called [atoi](https://manual.cs50.io/3/atoi)). You want to be thorough in your development process and plan to try several approaches before deciding on the most efficient.\n",

    "In this problem, you will start with a simple implementation of `atoi` that handles positive ints using loops. You want to rework this into an implementation that uses recursion. Recusive functions can be memory intensive and are not always the best solution, but there are some problems in which using recursion can provide a simpler and more elegant solution.\n",

It uses eight bits to represent red values, eight bits for green and eight bits for blue. Since each color uses eight bits or one byte, we can use a number in the range of `0` to `255` to represent its color value. In hexadecimal, this is represented by `0x00` to `0xff`. By mixing together these red, green and blue values, we can create millions of possible colors.\n",

A 24-bit BMP file, then, is essentially just a sequence of bits, (almost) every 24 of which happen to represent some pixel’s color. But a BMP file also contains some “metadata,” information like an image’s height and width. That metadata is stored at the beginning of the file in the form of two data structures generally referred to as **“headers”**, not to be confused with C’s header files.

However, BMP stores these triples backwards (i.e., as BGR), with 8 bits for blue, followed by 8 bits for green, followed by 8 bits for red. (Some BMPs also store the entire bitmap backwards, with an image’s top row at the end of the BMP file. But we’ve stored this problem set’s BMPs as described herein, with each bitmap’s top row first and bottom row last.) In other words, were we to convert the 1-bit smiley above to a 24-bit smiley, substituting red for black, a 24-bit BMP would store this bitmap as follows, where 0000ff signifies red and ffffff signifies white; we’ve highlighted in red all instances of 0000ff."

    "\n",
    "Recall that if the red, green, and blue values are all set to 0x00 (hexadecimal for 0), then the pixel is black. And if all values are set to 0xff (hexadecimal for 255), then the pixel is white. So long as the red, green, and blue values are all equal, the result will be varying shades of gray along the black-white spectrum, with higher values meaning lighter shades (closer to white) and lower values meaning darker shades (closer to black).\n",
    "\n",
    "So to convert a pixel to grayscale, we just need to make sure the red, green, and blue values are all the same value. But how do we know what value to make them? Well, it’s probably reasonable to expect that if the original red, green, and blue values were all pretty high, then the new value should also be pretty high. And if the original values were all low, then the new value should also be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, to ensure each pixel of the new image still has the same general brightness or darkness as the old image, we can take the average of the red, green, and blue values to determine what shade of grey to make the new pixel.\n",

    "Like image blurring, edge detection also works by taking each pixel, and modifying it based on the `3x3` grid of pixels that surrounds that pixel. But instead of just taking the average of the nine pixels, the Sobel operator computes the new value of each pixel by taking a weighted sum of the values for the surrounding pixels. And since edges between objects could take place in both a vertical and a horizontal direction, you’ll actually compute two weighted sums: one for detecting edges in the x direction, and one for detecting edges in the y direction. In particular, you’ll use the following two “kernels”:"

    "- multiply them each by the corresponding value in the `Gx` kernel, and \n",
    "- take the sum of the resulting values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why these particular values for the kernel? In the `Gx` direction, for instance, we’re multiplying the pixels to the right of the target pixel by a positive number, and multiplying the pixels to the left of the target pixel by a negative number. When we take the sum, if the pixels on the right are a similar color to the pixels on the left, the result will be close to `0` (the numbers cancel out). But if the pixels on the right are very different from the pixels on the left, then the resulting value will be very positive or very negative, indicating a change in color that likely is the result of a boundary between objects. And a similar argument holds true for calculating edges in the `y` direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these kernels, we can generate a `Gx` and `Gy` value for each of the red, green, and blue channels for a pixel. But each channel can only take on one value, not two: so we need some way to combine `Gx` and `Gy` into a single value. The Sobel filter algorithm combines `Gx` and `Gy` into a final value by calculating the square root of $Gx^2 + Gy^2$. And since channel values can only take on integer values from 0 to 255, be sure the resulting value is rounded to the nearest integer and capped at 255!\n",
    "\n",
    "And what about handling pixels at the edge, or in the corner of the image? There are many ways to handle pixels at the edge, but for the purposes of this problem, we’ll ask you to treat the image as if there was a 1 pixel solid black border around the edge of the image: therefore, trying to access a pixel past the edge of the image should be treated as a solid black pixel (values of `0` for each of red, green, and blue). This will effectively ignore those pixels from our calculations of `Gx` and `Gy`.\n",

And we could just remember that the byte at `array[i]` represents one thing, while the byte at `array[j]` represents another. But why not give some of those bytes names so that we can retrieve them from memory more easily? That’s precisely what the structs in `bmp.h` allow us to do.

    "Implement the functions in `helpers.c` such that a user can apply `grayscale`, `reflection`, `blur`, or `edge` detection filters to their images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function `grayscale` should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.\n",
    "- The `reflect` function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.\n",
    "- The `blur` function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.\n",
    "- The `edges` function should take an image and highlight the edges between objects, according to the Sobel operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not modify any of the function signatures, nor should you modify any other files other than `helpers.c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should behave per the examples below. `INFILE.bmp` is the name of the input image and `OUTFILE.bmp` is the name of the resulting image after a filter has been applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./filter -g INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp\n",
    "$ ./filter -r INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp\n",
    "$ ./filter -b INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp\n",
    "$ ./filter -e INFILE.bmp OUTFILE.bmp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of a pixel’s `rgbtRed`, `rgbtGreen`, and `rgbtBlue` components are all integers, so be sure to round any floating-point numbers to the nearest integer when assigning them to a pixel value!"
